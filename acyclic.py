class TheoreticalAcyclicityOracle:
    """
    A theoretical Qiskit implementation of a fully quantum acyclicity oracle.

    This class constructs a QuantumCircuit object representing an oracle that
    can detect cycles in a directed graph encoded in a quantum register. The
    construction is for theoretical and educational purposes, as the core
    subroutines (block-encoding a matrix based on a superposition of graphs)
    are not practically implementable on current or near-term hardware.

    The oracle checks the condition Tr(A^k) != 0 for k=1 to N, where A is the
    adjacency matrix of the graph.
